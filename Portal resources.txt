OCR Details

Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the mechanical or electronic conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example from a television broadcast).[1]

Widely used as a form of information entry from printed paper data records – whether passport documents, invoices, bank statements, computerized receipts, business cards, mail, printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation – it is a common method of digitizing printed texts so that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as cognitive computing, machine translation, (extracted) text-to-speech, key data and text mining. OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and computer vision.

Early versions needed to be trained with images of each character, and worked on one font at a time. Advanced systems capable of producing a high degree of recognition accuracy for most fonts are now common, and with support for a variety of digital image file format inputs.[2] Some systems are capable of reproducing formatted output that closely approximates the original page including images, columns, and other non-textual components.


Applications
OCR engines have been developed into many kinds of domain-specific OCR applications, such as receipt OCR, invoice OCR, check OCR, legal billing document OCR.

They can be used for:

Data entry for business documents, e.g. check, passport, invoice, bank statement and receipt
Automatic number plate recognition
In airports, for passport recognition and information extraction
Automatic insurance documents key information extraction
Extracting business card information into a contact list[9]
More quickly make textual versions of printed documents, e.g. book scanning for Project Gutenberg
Make electronic images of printed documents searchable, e.g. Google Books
Converting handwriting in real time to control a computer (pen computing)
Defeating CAPTCHA anti-bot systems, though these are specifically designed to prevent OCR.[10][11][12] The purpose can also be to test the robustness of CAPTCHA anti-bot systems.
