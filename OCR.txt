How do I approach and build an OCR from scratch?

You need to understand the architecture for building OCR, some important steps in OCR are :

1). Image Acquisition

2). Pre-Processing

3). Segmentation

4). Feature Extraction and Normalization

5). Classification and Recognition

These steps are guided/driven by collection of training and testing datasets, and training processes used for training classifiers.

Some popular OCR APIs

Open Source Frameworks:
There are a couple of open source frameworks that can be used to build an OCR framework in house. They are effective too as long as you know how to train it for your requirements. Listed below are a couple of such frameworks.


Python pyocr ( GNU/Linux systems )
Tesseract-OCR
Most OCR frameworks out there is probably built on top of Tesseract and it is the most popular among the bunch which has pretty good outcomes.
